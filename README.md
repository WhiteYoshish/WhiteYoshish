# WhiteYoshish

**Self-Taught | Linux Enthusiast | Security Research**

Building complex systems independently. Using AI as force multiplier, not crutch.

---

## Current Focus

- Self-hosted AI infrastructure (Ollama, Open WebUI, 9-container Docker stack)
- Linux systems (recently migrated from Windows to CachyOS - native, not WSL)
- Security research (reverse engineering, memory manipulation, game trainers)
- DevOps/SRE (Docker orchestration, service automation, performance tuning)

## What I've Build

**Self-Hosted AI Stack** (9 services, GPU-accelerated)
- Ollama (RTX 5080 16GB) running abliterated models
- Open WebUI + Pipelines for function calling
- SearXNG, Pi-hole, Navidrome, Vaultwarden
- Tailscale mesh VPN for remote access

**Network Security Tools**
- Packet analyzer with 523 YARA malware signatures
- Live capture, credential extraction, WebSocket dashboard
- Flask API + real-time monitoring

**Minecraft Server Infrastructure**
- 46-mod modded server with custom lore system
- Discord bot integration (40+ commands)
- Automated crash recovery and monitoring

**Reverse Engineering**
- Game trainer development (Cheat Engine, Ghidra, x64dbg)
- Memory manipulation for educational research
- System internals exploration

## Current Projects

**Linux Migration** - Moved entire dev environment from Windows 11 → CachyOS (Arch)
**Local AI Infrastructure** - Building fully offline AI stack (privacy-first)
**Security Research** - Educational reverse engineering and memory analysis

## Philosophy

**On Learning:** AI collapsed the Linux learning barrier from 40 hours → 2 hours. Same depth, 10x faster. Knowledge gatekeeping is dead.

**On AI Assistance:** Transparent about building with Claude Code/Opus 4.5. Modern development = effective tool use. Understanding > copying.

**On Privacy:** Minimal Big Tech footprint. Local AI (no cloud APIs), self-hosted services, privacy-respecting alternatives.

## Learning Style

- AI-accelerated learning - use Claude Code for exploration, not answers
- Build mental models - understand WHY, not just HOW
- Document everything - 3000+ line context docs, systematic note-taking
- Learn by building - complex projects > tutorials

## Hardware

- **CPU:** Ryzen 9 7900X (12c/24t)
- **GPU:** RTX 5080 16GB GDDR7
- **RAM:** 32GB DDR5
- **OS:** CachyOS (Arch-based, kernel-optimized for gaming)

## Career Interests

Exploring multiple paths in tech:
- Cybersecurity/Offensive Security - pentesting, red team operations
- DevOps/SRE - infrastructure, performance optimization
- AI Infrastructure Engineer - local model deployment, optimization
- Independent Security Researcher - bug bounties, vulnerability research

Portfolio-focused approach - building real systems over traditional credentials.

## Fun Fact

The term "bug" in computing originated from an actual moth found trapped in the Harvard Mark II computer in 1947 by Grace Hopper. The moth is still preserved in the Naval Surface Warfare Center archives.

### Built with AI Assistance

Projects developed using Claude Code (Opus 4.5) for acceleration.
**Code is mine. AI is the debugger, documentation writer, and research assistant.**

*"Make it work, make it big, make it legendary."*
